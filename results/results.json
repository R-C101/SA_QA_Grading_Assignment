The model is trained using input-output pairs, and the goal is to minimize errors by predicting outputs accurately during the training process.", "points": 3.5, "max_points": 4, "feedback": "The answer correctly defines supervised learning and mentions labeled data and the goal of minimizing errors.  However, it could benefit from mentioning the use of this learned model for prediction on *unseen* data, a key aspect of supervised learning.  The explanation is concise and clear."}, {"question_id": "q3", "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?", "student_answer": "Overfitting happens when the model is too large for the dataset and can be avoided by increasing the number of layers in a neural network.", "points": 1.0, "max_points": 4, "feedback": "FEEDBACK:The answer partially defines overfitting, mentioning model size relative to the dataset. However, it incorrectly suggests that increasing the number of layers avoids overfitting;  in fact, it can exacerbate the problem.  The explanation lacks crucial details about the model learning noise instead of underlying patterns. A more complete answer should include concepts like high variance and poor generalization to unseen data."}], "overall_feedback": "You're on the right track, but need to review the material more thoroughly."}
